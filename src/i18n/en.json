Born out of the Synthetix ecosystem, Thales leverages ChainLink provided price feeds, 0x limit order books, and the sUSD stablecoin to provide participants a novel on-chain, permissionless, and non-custodial way to participate in the price movement of crypto assets and certain non-crypto assets."

                "section1": "Decentralized derivatives present a novel opportunity to disintermediate barriers that divide global markets, reducing net efficiency and leaving market segments vulnerable to opacity. Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives experienced tremendous growth, notably in the form of perpetual swaps and vanilla options on centralized platforms. With a high counter-party risk of centralized solutions, the need for trustless, self-custodied, decentralized crypto asset derivative products is clear. Thales’ goal is to contribute to alleviating this need by providing participants a novel on-chain, permissionless, versatile, and non-custodial derivative protocol.",
                "section2": "Thales enables participants to take part in price movement or certain on-chain outcomes of supported assets around available on-chain data feeds. Thales accomplishes this by utilizing its own parimutuel markets mechanism. These parimutuel markets are deployable by any user and are collateralized by uncensorable and decentralized stablecoin sUSD, the flagship product of Synthetix. These markets are deployed with custom strike threshold and maturity date, allowing unprecedented versatility. The majority of on-chain data feeds used by Thales parimutuel markets stem from Chainlink and are used as immutable sources of truth for market settlement.",

The definition of Parimutuel Market is a market where collateral is placed in a pool and final payout to participants is not determined until the market-settling event is finalized. By leveraging the secure, permissionless and non-custodial nature of Ethereum smart contracts, every participant is able to form a Thales parimutuel market around supported assets with custom parameters and every participant is able to participate in any formed Thales parimutuel market. Other than versatility and openness, when compared to other trading platforms, Thales parimutuel markets have the benefits of a limited risk environment. With capped downside and capped upside, both calculable from the start, participants are exposed to an easily understandable and familiar way to take advantage of various assets’ price-movements (or lack thereof).",

Depending on how this market’s particular event manifests in reality, the smart contracts underlying a Parimutuel Market will autonomously and independently execute according to the rules and terms established from the aggregated activity of the relevant Market Participants.",

Further, some crypto-assets that are not natively tracked by the Ethereum blockchain (such as BTC) may also form the basis for Parimutuel Market events. This is accomplished by utilizing a network-authenticated reference data providers of information that can be read and processed on the blockchain, called ”oracles”. Given Thales’ goal of a system without a specific, discrete, and unilateral point of failure, the protocol relies on the ChainLink decentralized oracle solution project to provide this information.",

Synthetix is an open-source project that provides crypto-assets (namely, the Synths) whose value tracks that of Reference Assets without the need of a centralized authority or intermediary. Minting sUSD as a synth is functionally equivalent to issuing a fiat-denominated liability against the liquid market value of the ERC-20 collateral, denominated in “SNX,” the crypto-asset native to Synthetix. Holding sUSD is much safer for users who wish to avoid censorship risks, frustrations associated with traditional banking or financial services, associated with temporary geographical location, and the volatility inherent in many other crypto-assets. sUSD is overcollateralized several times, meaning there is anywhere from 4–7 times worth of SNX collateral backing the fiat value of each sUSD. This approach is intended to preemptively mitigate aforementioned risks before they manifest and causes Synthetix to achieve its mission towards stable sUSD value. Further, the fully developed use cases designed around sUSD enable the Protocol to function smoothly for the foreseeable future. There’s no way to stop one person from sending another person sUSD. Similarly, there is no way to stop a participant from minting Positional Tokens on Thales with sUSD and there is no way to stop a participant from exercising his winning Positional Tokens for sUSD. In the event of a front-end not being functional for whatever reason, a user could always interact with the Thales smart contracts directly through a blockchain explorer."

Currently there are two distinct types of Positional Tokens: those which insure a position in case a certain market event resolves positively and those which insure a position in case a market event resolves negatively. These Positional Tokens are minted by Market Creators and Market Makers. When forming a market, Market Creator needs to deposit sufficient collateral to cover both ends of the market. This collateral is locked in that specific market’s smart contract, which proportionally mints both types of the Positional Tokens. The amount of Positional Tokens minted corresponds to the amount of collateral deposited, so only one side of the tokens (the winning side) will be able to redeem the collateral in 1:1 ratio, while the other side will be deemed worthless. Market Creators are not the only participants who provide collateral. Other participants, the Market Makers, may also provide additional sUSD collateral to increase the pool size and subsequently mint Positional Tokens for that specific Parimutuel Market. The only technical difference between Market Makers and Market Creator is that Market Creators initiated a relevant Pool’s creation. As Market Makers mint positional tokens on a market initiated by a particular Market Creator, that Market Creator will receive a part of fees assessed on those transactions while the rest of the fees are allocated towards the ThalesDAO fee pool."
